# Conway's Game of Life

This is a visual simulation of the lifecycle of cellular automata, as defined by the rules of John Conway's Game of Life.

## Rules of the Game of Life
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules)

- Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives
- Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell
- All other cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead

## Cellular Automaton
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)

Enjoying benefits in wide-ranging fields such as processors, cryptography, chemistry, and biology, the Cellular Automaton is a discrete cellular theory model consisting of a grid of cells that each have finite state (such as off or on). Generations progress according to rules (like Conway's above) which govern each cell based on the state of its neighbors.

## Turing Complete
Because Conway's Game of Life can create automata in which patterns become extremely complex and may last for a long time with stable local structures, they are computationally universal, or capable of simulating a Turing Machine. Anything that can be computed algorithmically can be computed in the Game of Life.


## Technology
The application is made in React, and is deployed on Heroku.
